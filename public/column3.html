                        1. Play the Auction House
                    </h2>
                    <p>The Auction House is one of those hidden gems that can 
                        help you earn lots of gold in WoW. The basic premise is 
                        buying low and selling high. The other thing to do is to 
                        corner the market. Buy up all of an item (usually a trade 
                        skill item—herbs, metal, etc.) and resell them at a much higher price. 
                        It requires constant commitment, though.
                        To get the flow of gold going, you will have to let your 
                        items expire and then re-list them immediately. You have to 
                        find new items to buy depending on what is the demand at the time, 
                        so ensure you keep up with the trends of what item is needed at any 
                        given time. A new patch can throw the market into chaos, which is the 
                        best time to pick up a lot of gold or a lot of items cheaply.
                        The Auction House has gone through a lot of changes to prevent scams, 
                        so while it may not be the gold mine it once was, it can still be profitable.
                        Keep in mind you will lose money sometimes and you won't always be able 
                        to sell every item. There are times you need to cut your losses and move on!</p>

                        2. Be a Tank!
                    </h2>

                        <p>
                            Being a tank is the best way to earn a lot of gold. Tanks currently control 
                            the grouping landscape in Warcraft. Earning extra rewards by participating in 
                            random instances where tanks are needed is a great way to earn unexpected, and 
                            sometimes random, amounts of gold. Also, reward bags can contain gold and other
                            items. One of the items that always sells well is the companions. At one point, 
                            I was given the Firefly pet from my bag, which sells for thousands of gold for the server I am on.

                        3. Max Out Crafting Skills
                    </h2>

                        <p>
                            As risky and costly as it might sound, having two crafting skills will pay off in the long run.
                            Besides the fact that you have two skills to upgrade your gear, you will have two skills to choose 
                            from to make gold with. In every expansion or patch, some skills swing from being stagnant to in-demand. 
                            Having two crafting skills will allow you to take advantage of the situation. You may pay a lot for 
                            materials, but you could also craft items using supplies provided by people, which people tip plenty for.
                            On the flip-side, having two gathering skills is virtually all profit with no loss. With a lot of 
                            effort and time, you can have a lot of resources to sell off on the Auction House. Just ensure you 
                            follow tip one so you get as much money as possible. It's debatable on what those skills should be, 
                            but Mining should be one of them. Ore has always proven to be one of the most valuable resources to 
                            sell. With a lot of hard work, you can become rich in no time.
