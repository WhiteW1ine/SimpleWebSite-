                <p>Menethil, Crown Prince of Lordaeron and Knight of the Silver Hand, was the son of 
                    King Terenas Menethil II and heir to the throne. He was trained as a paladin by Uther 
                    the Lightbringer and was inducted into the Order of the Silver Hand. Arthas also had a romantic  
                    relationship with the kind sorceress Jaina Proudmoore. Committed to the protection 
                    of his people, Arthas was determined to stop the plague spreading throughout Lordaeron. </p> 
                <br>
                <p>                Despite his promising beginnings, Arthas became one of the most powerful and evil beings 
                    Azeroth would ever know. Although he killed the necromancer Kel'Thuzad, Arthas was unable 
                    to stop the spread of the plague and resorted to increasingly desperate methods, such as 
                    purging the city of Stratholme. Taking up the cursed runeblade Frostmourne, Arthas was able 
                    to defeat the demon Mal'Ganis, but he lost his soul in the process. Becoming a death knight 
                    of the Scourge, he led the undead in destroying Lordaeron, Quel'Thalas, and Dalaran. Arthas 
                    later made his way to the Frozen Throne of Icecrown and merged with the Lich King.</p>

                Ruling as the Lich King for years afterward, Arthas had the last remnants of his humanity destroyed 
                and was ultimately defeated in combat by Highlord Tirion Fordring and his champions of the Light. 
                Cradled by the spirit of his father, Arthas Menethil died, leaving the mantle of the Lich King to 
                be taken by a noble soul who would contain the power of the Scourge. Arthas' soul found no rest in 
                the afterlife, instead being forged into a weapon in the schemes of the Jailer that was spent until nothing was left.
